# S&P 500 Index - Time Series Forecasting

This project is part of the ADS-506: Applied Time Series Analysis course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego.

The S&P 500 Index is a valuable benchmark for the US stock market and consists of shares of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the United States.
By understanding trends, seasonality, and the factors that influence the value of the S&P 500, analysts can better understand the risk of investment into the popular stock market index, and better understand when are the best times to make investments.

## Background

Traffic congestion is not only frustrating, but also costs individuals and companies thousands of dollars a year in fuel consumption, delayed deliveries, and billable labor hours. Over the past few years, an increase in online shopping- thanks to companies like Amazon has put more delivery trucks on the road. Some large companies, such as Wal-Mart and Kroger, began implementing penalties on trucking companies for delayed deliveries. The steady increase of traffic over past decades affects more than your average commuter, but the global and local economy. In many cities there is deferred maintenance of public infrastructure coupled with an increased number of vehicles on the road, and increased demand for delivered goods. A better understanding of, and an accurate method of predicting, traffic congestion is necessary for route planning, allocation of infrastructure improvements, emergency response plans, etc. 

## Problem Statement

The goal for this project is to accurately forecast, with 95% confidence, traffic congestion for the next 24 hours. Forecasting traffic can give fleet managers, those who manage truck drivers and deliveries, better insight to reduce consumption costs by steering their drivers away from traffic consumption. Forecasts can also help individuals optimize travels and reduce their annual cost of transportation by decreasing cost associated with travel time. This project is a low level example of how forecasting can be used in this industry, therefore future research will describe how a successful model can be automated and implemented. 


## Data 

This dataset details the number of vehicles that pass through one of 4 different traffic intersections on an hourly basis from November 1, 2015 to June 30, 2017. The dataset contains a total of 481,120 recordings in total.
