# S&P 500 Index - Time Series Forecasting

This project is part of the ADS-506: Applied Time Series Analysis course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego.

The S&P 500 Index is a valuable benchmark for the US stock market and consists of shares of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the United States.
By understanding trends, seasonality, and the factors that influence the value of the S&P 500, analysts can better understand the risk of investment into the popular stock market index, and better understand when are the best times to make investments.

## Objective

The S&P 500 Index consists of shares of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the US stock market, which represents a significant segment of investment in the US stock market.

Bearish investors have long characterized the S&P 500 anecdotally as overvalued without being able to model a fair price for the index themselves.
By analyzing the performance of the companies in the S&P 500 using factors describing company performance, this project will attempt to fairly predict the value of the S&P 500.
For individual investors that want to better understand the best time to make their investment, this project will be a tool that can provide them with insights on what will be a fair value price for the S&P 500 index based on the historical relationships between company performance and the index price.
The challenges for this model will be that the stock market is generally difficult to predict and there are global macroeconomic factors not included in the dataset that can have a large impact on the index price.

## Project Description

Discuss the details of project overview.
Description your selected dataset, such as data source, number of variables, size of dataset, etc.
Include data dictionary if, available.
Provide questions and hypothesis that you are exploring.

etc.

## Data Source

The data was acquired via DataHub.io (<https://datahub.io/core/s-and-p-500#data>)

The dataset includes 10 features, and 1768 monthly records for the value of the S&P 500, dividends, earnings, consumer price index, long interest rate, real price, real dividend, and real earnings per share from January, 1871 to April of 2018.
